# Root Updates Archive

This directory contains all of the ad-hoc summaries, troubleshooting notes, and implementation reports that previously lived in the repository root.

## Why this folder exists

- Keeps `/` focused on active source code and build configuration
- Preserves the historical write-ups for reference
- Makes it easier to find related updates in one place

## Finding documents

- Files keep their original names so existing references still make sense
- Use your editor's search (`⌘ + P` / `Ctrl + P`) and type part of the filename (e.g., `DATATABLE_UPDATE_PLAN`)
- For recurring reference docs, prefer the structured guides already under `docs/`

If you add another one-off report, place it here instead of the repository root.
