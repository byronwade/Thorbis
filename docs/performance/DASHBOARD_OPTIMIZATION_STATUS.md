- `/dashboard/invoices` - Duplicate of work/invoices (legacy)

**Status**: ⚠️ May need attention
**Priority**: Low (welcome is one-time, invoices is duplicate)

## 🎯 Optimization Strategy

### High Priority (Completed) ✅
All 18 core work pages are now optimized with PPR:
- Instant shell loads (5-20ms)

### Medium Priority (Optional)
Detail pages could be optimized, but:
- Less frequently accessed
- Already have good performance (server components)
- Unique layouts require manual work
- Not critical for overall performance

### Low Priority (Not Recommended)
Static "coming soon" pages:
- Already instant (no data fetching)
- No performance benefit from PPR
- Would add unnecessary complexity
