Safe Execution Using eval() and new Function(): The document suggests strategies for interpreting custom code on the client side, specifically using eval() or new Function() for converting JSON-stored code into executable React components. However, these methods include:
Strict Security Checks: To prevent XSS vulnerabilities, all code execution is subjected to strict sanitization and validation. Alternative solutions like sandboxed iframes may also be considered for isolated code execution.
Dynamic Imports for Framer Motion: For components requiring animation, Framer Motion is dynamically imported only when needed, optimizing load times and minimizing the footprint on the initial bundle.
Component Loader and Rendering Script

The Component Loader is responsible for fetching component configurations from the registry and parsing them into executable components. This loader script:
Retrieves JSON data and interprets it as a React component, injecting Framer Motion animations and styles.
Dynamically imports required libraries or dependencies, leveraging CDN-hosted versions to prevent adding unused libraries to the bundle.
Mounts components to specified DOM elements on the client side, ensuring they render smoothly within the overall page layout.
Service Worker and CDN Caching for Optimization

Service Worker Strategy: Service workers cache frequently used libraries (e.g., Framer Motion, Emotion) after their first load, reducing future network requests and improving page load times.
CDN Caching: Component bundles stored in the registry are delivered via CDN, ensuring efficient retrieval and scalability. This CDN caching setup:
Reduces load on the database by caching frequently requested components.
Accelerates component retrieval times, especially for geographically diverse users, by serving content from the nearest CDN node.
Developer Workflow for Custom Code Integration

Admin Panel Management: Custom code and components are added or updated via the Thorbis CMS admin panel, which allows content creators and developers to configure component properties, animations, and styles.
Micro-Build Process for Custom Code: The document suggests a micro-build approach, where each custom component or code snippet is bundled independently, making updates modular and reducing the impact on the overall site architecture.
Modular Component Loading on Client Sites: Developers using the Thorbis npm package can access custom code stored in the registry, enabling client websites to dynamically load and render these components on demand without requiring extensive backend updates.
Error Handling and Fallback Content

To ensure a seamless user experience, the document highlights the need for error handling mechanisms. If a component fails to load or render, fallback content maintains the page structure and prevents display issues.
Modularity and Maintainability: By isolating each component and managing errors at the component level, the Thorbis system remains modular and maintainable, with the ability to address specific component issues without affecting the entire site.
