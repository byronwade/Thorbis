# New Thorbis

## Overview

Thorbis is a decoupled CMS platform that orchestrates website management through existing cloud services. It provides a centralized management system for websites while leveraging third-party infrastructure for hosting and deployment. The system is built around a "bring your own credentials" model where users maintain complete control of their service integrations.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Infrastructure Model

- **Serverless Architecture**: All components run on serverless infrastructure.
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite (initial implementation).
- **Deployment**: User-owned Vercel integration for website hosting.
- **Version Control**: User-owned GitHub integration for code management.
- **Authentication**: OAuth-based system for multiple services with user-owned credentials.
- **Dynamic Content Editing System**: A component-based system allowing users to control layout, design, and content through the CMS.

### 2. System Components

### 6. Implementation Guidelines

### 6.1 Component System

**Component Definition Example (`thoris.config.ts`):**

```tsx
typescript
Copy code
export const components = [
  {
    name: 'HeroSection',
    properties: {
      title: { type: 'string', default: 'Welcome to Thorbis' },
      subtitle: { type: 'string', default: '' },
      backgroundImage: { type: 'image', default: null },
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'FeatureList',
    properties: {
      features: {
        type: 'list',
        items: {
          icon: { type: 'icon', default: 'default-icon' },
          title: { type: 'string', default: 'Feature Title' },
          description: { type: 'string', default: 'Feature Description' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  // ...additional components
];

```

**Component Registration:**

- Thorbis reads the `thoris.config.ts` file during project setup or updates.
- Components are parsed and stored in the `Component` model.
- Properties schema is stored for use in the visual editor.

- **Properties Panel**: Users can edit component properties with form inputs matching the properties schema.
- **Real-Time Preview**: Users see immediate feedback on changes.
- **Responsive Design Tools**: Options to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.

### 6.3 Rendering Engine

- **Data Binding**: Components receive data from the `Content` model during rendering.
- **SSR and CSR Support**: Compatible with both server-side and client-side rendering as needed.
- **Performance Optimization**:
    - Implement caching strategies.
    - Use lazy loading for components and assets.

### 6.4 Content Storage

- **Structured Data**: Content is stored in a structured format, allowing for efficient querying and manipulation.
- **Versioning**: Implement content versioning for rollback capabilities.
- **Collaboration Support**: Track changes and support multiple users editing content.
